"""Which part of the stack runs where: the board keeps the reflexes, the laptop takes the rest.

The board is four Cortex-A53 cores. Whatever closes a control loop or owns a frame stays on
it: the sensors, the EKF, the tracker (map->odom), the controller with its local costmap, the
behaviours and the tree that orders them. Whatever answers once a second and tolerates a
wireless hop moves to the laptop: the planner with the global costmap, the goal server with its
recorder. The split is data, so a test can hold it and the launch file merely reads it.
