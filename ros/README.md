# Pepin on ROS 2 Jazzy + Nav2 (branch `ros2-nav2`)

The navigation stack moves to Nav2; everything ROS runs **on the board** in one Docker
container (the board is Armbian Debian trixie, which has no Jazzy binaries; the container
is Ubuntu 24.04 with the official `ros:jazzy-ros-base` image). The laptop only watches,
through Foxglove Studio. Reason: the wifi to the board has 300-700 ms latency spikes; a
20 Hz controller on the laptop would drive through them the way our first wheel loop did.

What stays from the Python stack:

- `pepin.base_server` on the board still owns the wheels (50 Hz, 0.5 s deadman). The ROS
  node `base_bridge` maps `/cmd_vel` to it and publishes `/odom` and the `odom -> base_link`
  transform from its state stream.
- `pepin.tof_server` feeds `tof_bridge`, which publishes three `sensor_msgs/Range` topics.
- Saved maps (`data/maps/*.npz`) convert to Nav2 maps with `ros/tools/npz_to_map.py`.

## Layout

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `ros/Dockerfile` | Jazzy base + nav2, nav2-bringup, slam-toolbox, foxglove-bridge, CycloneDDS; LD19 driver ([Myzhar/ldrobot-lidar-ros2](https://github.com/Myzhar/ldrobot-lidar-ros2)) built from source; our `pepin_bringup` |
| `ros/run.sh` | `docker run` with host networking, the lidar device and `ros/maps`, `ros/params` mounted |
| `ros/pepin_bringup/` | ament_python package: `base_bridge`, `tof_bridge`, launch files |
| `ros/params/` | Nav2 parameters for this cart (footprint, speeds, rates for a weak CPU) |
| `ros/maps/` | Converted maps (`<name>.pgm` + `<name>.yaml`) |
| `ros/tools/npz_to_map.py` | Our occupancy grid -> map_server format |

## Build and run (on the board)

```bash
# from the laptop: copy ros/ to the board and build the image (15-30 min the first time)
rsync -a --delete ros/ root@pepin.local:/root/pepin-ros/
ssh root@pepin.local 'cd /root/pepin-ros && docker build -t pepin-ros .'
# on the board: sensors + bridges + foxglove_bridge
ssh root@pepin.local '/root/pepin-ros/run.sh ros2 launch pepin_bringup robot.launch.py'
# on the board, second terminal: navigation on a saved map
ssh root@pepin.local '/root/pepin-ros/run.sh ros2 launch pepin_bringup nav.launch.py map:=/maps/lap3.yaml'
```

Laptop: install Foxglove Studio (`brew install --cask foxglove-studio`), open a connection
to `ws://pepin.local:8765`, add the 3D panel with `/map`, `/ldlidar_node/scan`, `/tf`, the costmaps and
`/plan`; send a goal with the "Publish" panel on `/goal_pose` (`geometry_msgs/PoseStamped`,
frame `map`).

## Bring-up checklist (in this order, each step visible in Foxglove)

1. `robot.launch.py` alone: `/ldlidar_node/scan` at ~10 Hz, `/odom` at 20 Hz, TF `odom -> base_link -> laser`.
   Push the cart forward by hand: `/odom` x grows. Turn it left: theta grows.
2. Laser orientation: a wall in front of the cart must draw at +x in `base_link`. Our lidar
   is mounted upside down and the LD19 counts angles clockwise; the static transform in the
   launch file uses roll = pi and yaw = -87.5 degrees (from `config/lidar.json`). If the scan
   comes out mirrored left/right, set `laser_roll:=0.0`.
3. `nav.launch.py`: AMCL converges on the map after a few metres of teleop (or set the initial
   pose from Foxglove); then a goal.
4. Memory: `free -m` on the board while navigating; the container must stay under ~700 MB.

## Frames and conventions

`base_link` sits between the drive-wheel contact points (our robot frame): x forward, y left.
Footprint (meters, `base_link`): front 0.0625, rear 0.30, half-width 0.275 — from `config/base.json`.
